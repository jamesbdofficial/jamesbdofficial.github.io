							<h2>Previous Employment</h2>
							<blockquote><h3>Software Developer at <a href="https://www.symology.co.uk/">Symology:</a> <u>July 2021 – Present</u></h3>
                                As a software developer for Symology I have mainly used C#, .NET and SQL. I was able to thoroughly extend my knowledge in these languages as well as 
								using Git, Visual Studio and Azure DevOps for version control. Being a part of a company and working on a big project was extremely insightful as to how
								a company of this size operates, as well as expanding my ability to work on.
                            </blockquote>

                                Trained and working as a ‘Skilled Barista’. My responsibilities entailed having to serve customers at the till, be responsible for making both hot and 
								cold drinks for customers. I would also work in the kitchen and on the floor, clearing and cleaning tables and putting them through the dishwasher. 
								My time at Costa Coffee has massively improved my ability to interact with customers and has also made me much better at working in a team.

								colleagues.

								techniques for tennis practise and matches. Very rewarding seeing my students develop over many years and has given me confidence in dealing with children
