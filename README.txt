MY PERSONAL ONLINE PORTFOLIO - James Brozicevic - Doran.

This repository stores the files for my online portfolio, which is hosted by GitHub.

It contains all personal projects that I am happy to show (which means they work fully and I am proud to show them).
It also contains a copy of my CV, as well as a more in-depth look at each of the projects on the website.
